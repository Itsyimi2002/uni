# Uni â€” Coding Samples by Yimi Shao

This repository contains a collection of coding samples developed as part of my undergraduate and graduate coursework at the **University of Nottingham** and the **University of Pennsylvania**. It shows projects that integrate environmental analysis, spatial modeling, and statistical forecasting using both **Python** and **R**.

## Contents

### [`coding_samples/`](coding_samples/)
A curated folder of scripts, reports, and datasets. Highlights include:

#### AMR Modeling in Python
- **File:** [`amr_model.py`](coding_samples/amr_model.py)
- **Dataset:** [`amrdata.txt`](coding_samples/amrdata.txt)
- **Description:** Simulates antibiotic resistance dynamics using an ODE-based model and MCMC calibration. Demonstrates parameter estimation, population modeling, and plotting.

#### Urban Growth Forecasting in R (Austin, TX)
- **Report:** [`austin_hw5.html`](coding_samples/austin_cw5%2023.13.00.html)
- **Assignment Prompt:** [`Urban Growth Modeling_task.pdf`](coding_samples/Urban%20Growth%20Modeling_task.pdf)
- **Description:** Logistic regression model that predicts urban land cover change in the Austin MSA through 2031 under a hypothetical highway scenario. Includes spatial feature engineering, scenario modeling, and land use planning recommendations.
